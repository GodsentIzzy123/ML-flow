This contains the code needed to run your first MLFlow model project

Ensure you have the .ipynb and requirements.txt file in the same folder

First , you need to set up the Python virtual environment in the folder where you want to execute the project using 

`python -mvenv venv`

Then, you install the ML flow library in the virtual environment via the Command Line Interface using

`pip install mlflow`

Futhermore, we will need to install the libraries contained in the requirements file using

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


Thereafter, you can run the jupyter notebook file to see the results I obtained
